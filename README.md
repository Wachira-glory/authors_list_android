In this Android project, I developed an app that displays a list of authors along with the books they have written, utilizing Kotlin as the programming language. The app features a scrollable list of authors with brief biographies, and when an author is selected, it displays a list of their books with titles, publication years, and descriptions. The app uses Android Architecture Components, including ViewModel and Binding, for efficient data management and UI updates. It also employs RecyclerView and custom adapters for handling large datasets and Material Design for a visually appealing interface. The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests and instrumentation tests to ensure reliability and correctness, showcasing my proficiency in creating a feature-rich and user-friendly app with a maintainable and scalable codebase.
